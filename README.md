# Sky Islands

This Python code can be used to input various overlapping rasters from different time periods and determine the change in NDVI values over that time. Originally this was used for determining desertification from 2005 to 2021 within the Sierra Los Ajos range in northern Mexico, but it can also be used to determine burn areas and other types of vegetation loss.
